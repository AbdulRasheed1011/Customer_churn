Results summary (before vs after tuning)

Before tuning (your earlier CatBoost run)
	•	TEST PR-AUC: 0.66294
	•	TEST F1: 0.61399
	•	Threshold (VAL): 0.65
	•	Recall: 0.6337

After tuning (this run)
	•	Best VAL PR-AUC: 0.69845 (selection metric)
	•	TEST PR-AUC: 0.66537 (small improvement)
	•	TEST F1: 0.63540 (big improvement)
	•	Threshold (VAL): 0.57
	•	TEST Recall: 0.7246 (major jump)
	•	Precision: 0.5658 (slightly lower than before, expected tradeoff)

Bottom line: tuning mostly improved your operating point (recall/F1), while PR-AUC improved slightly.
